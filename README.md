Java implementation of the rectcut layout strategy concept
from [halt.software](https://halt.software/dead-simple-layouts/) with a few more extensions.
The algorithm provides a simple way to split up a UI into sections.

Tiny library, no dependencies needed. Even though I'm going to use this with JavaFX, I tried keeping it as generic
and small as possible.
